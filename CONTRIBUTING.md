Thanks for you interest in contributing to FLIF!

FLIF is currently licensed under the GNU GPL v3+.
However, when the project is more mature, we (Jon Sneyers and Pieter Wuille, the primary authors of FLIF) will want to release it under a more permissive license.

For this reason, we ask contributors (i.e. authors of a pull request) to agree to the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) you can
find in the file FLIF-CLA-template.txt in this repository. That allows us to relicense FLIF, including your contributions, under a more
permissive license like for example the GNU LGPL or Apache 2.0 license.
More precisely, the set of _potential_ outbound licenses that can be considered,
are the GPL-Compatible Free Software Licenses as listed on this page:
https://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses

Please add your signed CLA to http://github.com/jonsneyers/FLIF-CLAs/
(you can find a template in FLIF-CLA-template.txt)
